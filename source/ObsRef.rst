====================

THIS IS A DRAFT

This will be updated once we have gone on sky and characterized.


Data Reduction
--------------

See `SEDM`_ for documentation on the data reduction pipeline.

.. _SEDM: http://www.astro.caltech.edu/sedm


Data Format & Fields of View
----------------------------

The IFU camera produces 2048 pixel square images.  The field-of-view of the IFU camera is 28\" on a side.  The imaging camera (iXon) produces 1024 pixel square images and has a field-of-view that is about 6\' on a side with a filter wheel of 10 positions (filters to be listed soon).  It is also capable of rapid photometry.


Exposure Time Estimates
-----------------------

This is from the original SEDM and will be updated once we go on sky.

IFU exposure time recommendations for standard stars:

* 10 - 11 mag --> 120s
* 11 - 12 mag --> 240s
* 12 - 13 mag --> 360s
* 13 - 14 mag --> 500s

IFU exposure time recommendations for science targets:

* 15 mag --> 420s
* 16 mag --> 600s
* 17 mag --> 900s
* 18 mag --> 1800s
* 19 mag --> 2250s
