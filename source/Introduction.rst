Introduction
============

It is widely accepted that time domain astronomy, particularly the
sub-fields of transient, variable star, and asteroid astronomy, is
undergoing exponential growth. Indeed, the selection of the Large Synoptic
Survey Telescope (LSST) by Astro-2010 explicitly recognizes that time
domain astronomy will enjoy a golden phase during this decade.  The
resurgence and revitalization of this field is due to technological
advances in sensors as well as computing.

We argue that the present approach of using "low" resolution spectrographs
(:math:`R=\lambda/\Delta\lambda\sim 1,000`) is overkill. Furthermore, the
traditional slit-spectrograph inevitably requires many minutes for object
acquisition, leading to a less than perfect "on source" efficiency. Here,
we present the design for a very low resolution (:math:`R\sim 100`)
Integral Field Unit (IFU) spectrograph (hereafter SED Machine or Spectral
Energy Distribution Machine, see the figure below) which
is sufficient for the classification of transient candidates, and when
mounted on a 1-m to 3-m class telescope, will perform this task more
efficiently than current instruments on larger aperture telescopes. The
greater availability of observing time on small aperture telescopes further
means that more candidates can be classified, and the classification can
occur closer to the discovery epoch.
