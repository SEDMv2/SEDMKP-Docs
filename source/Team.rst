I am currently an Assistant Professor of Physics and
Astronomy at the University of Minnesota. I am excited about using
SEDMv2 to discover the counterparts to gravitational waves, both
found by current instruments such as LIGO and future instruments such
as LISA, following up objects identified by surveys such as the 
Zwicky Transient Facility.
