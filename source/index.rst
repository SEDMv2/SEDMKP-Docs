Welcome to SED Machine Kitt Peak's documentation!
=================================================

THIS is ONLY a DRAFT!!
======================

SED Machine Kitt Peak is very low resolution (:math:`\frac{\lambda}{\Delta
\lambda}\sim100`) optical (365 - 1,000 nm) integral field (28"x"28")
spectrograph and an imager with a 6' x 6' field.  The instrument was 
designed for rapid classification of supernovae from transient surveys.
To achieve this goal, the instrument was designed to have:

- Low resolution (:math:`R=\frac{\lambda}{\Delta \lambda}\sim100`), sufficient for classification.
- High "Slit to detector" photon throughput.
- 0.1 mag precision spectrophotometry.

The hardware project was funded by the HSF with a grant to Caltech.  If you use
SEDM data please use the following text in your published papers:

If you use IFU data please cite: `Rigault, Neill, Walters, et al. 2019, A&A, 627, A115 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...627A.115R/abstract>`_.

Many people were involved.  Current members of the team are:

- Don Neill (Commissioning Scientist, IFU pipeline automation, Caltech)
- Mickael Rigault (IFU pipeline lead developer, CNRS/IN2P3, France)
- Reed Riddle (SEDM-KP software/operations)
- Yashvi Sharma (Caltech grad student)
- Josiah Purdum (Caltech)
- Alex Reedy (Caltech)

Here we document the instrument for observers and developers.  Observers
will want to refer to the Observer's Reference below.

Data products produced by the automatic pipeline can be found `here`_ (a
login account is required).
